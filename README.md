# CTC25
This is the home repository for [CTC25: Creating and Sharing Openly](https://codethecity.org/what-we-do/hack-weekends/ctc25/), which ran Saturday 19th February 2022 and Sunday 20th February 2022. The Miro board of ideas and work captured concepts well [CTC25 Miro Board](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVON-EGcw=/).

On Saturday we had 17 participants working on 3 challenges. On Sunday we had 14 participants working on the same 3 challenges. Participants were from Scotland and England. One person used the time to follow a personal project associated with flood maps and images from social media, and used the group as a sounding board for ideas, and help along the way.

We used our main Zoom session to hold the space and alternated between main room where everyone should be together, and breakout rooms for group work in 90 minutes blocks of time. We then came back together to check in on how teams were getting on, and to share information and offers of help.

We used Slack and our Code the City workgroup as the back channel between rooms, and to coordinate the event outside of Zoom. This worked well in the run-up to the event, and also as the jumping off point for each day.

## The Projects were
We had three teams working on a range of topics. All of them were continuations of previous projects.

### The Open Data Catalogue of Scottish Local Authorities
[The OD Bods](https://github.com/CodeTheCity/the_od_bods) which started at CTC23 continues as an opportunity for the team to work together. You can see their progress at https://opendatascotland.github.io/the_od_bods/ which feeds the website at https://opendata.scot The goal this weekend was to fix the data coming through from the APIs.

### Air Aberdeen
This project was discussed again to see how it might be revived further. The original site [Air Aberdeen]( https://www.airaberdeen.org) needed updating, and others were looking at seeing what's feasible with the sensor.community APIs by building on the work from [CTC16](https://github.com/AirAberdeen/CTC16-Data-Gathering), which is gathered into an [Air Aberdeen repo](https://github.com/AirAberdeen)

### Wikipedia Editathon
A team is working on a number of projects which can be tracked on the [CTC25 Dashboard](https://outreachdashboard.wmflabs.org/courses/CTC_and_WMUK/CTC25_Feb_2022). This group was working on two different projects: one tied to the granite quarries of the city; both in adding images of gravestones and details about the quarries, and the other to improving the information for the items associated with the artists recorded in the Aberdeen Art Gallery. Both were using a mix of editing by hand and using various tools to manipulate a range of items.
By the end of the weekend the following happened in this area: 224 Articles were Created, 4.51K Articles were Edited, 5.13K Total Edits, all done by 7 Editors, who added 466K Words, 124 References Added, 18.1K Article Views, 9 Commons Uploads, 4 files used in articles, 4 total usages across languages.
