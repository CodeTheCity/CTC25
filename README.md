# CTC25
This is the home repository for [CTC25: Creating and Sharing Openly](https://codethecity.org/what-we-do/hack-weekends/ctc25/), which ran Saturday 19th February 2022 and Sunday 20th February 2022. The Miro board of ideas and work captured concepts well [CTC25 Miro Board](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVON-EGcw=/).

On Saturday we had 17 participants working on 3 challenges. On Sunday we had ?? participants working on the same 3 challenges. Participants were from Scotland and England.

We used our main Zoom session to hold the space and alternated between main room where everyone should be together, and breakout rooms for group work in 90 minutes blocks of time. We then came back together to check in on how teams were getting on, and to share information and offers of help.

We used Slack and our Code the City workgroup as the back channel between rooms, and to coordinate the event outside of Zoom. This worked well in the run-up to the event, and also as the jumping off point for each day.

## The Projects were
We had three teams working on a range of topics. All of them were continuations of previous projects.

### The Open Data Catalogue of Scottish Local Authorities
[The OD Bods](https://github.com/CodeTheCity/the_od_bods) which started at CTC23 continues as an opportunity for the team to work together. You can see their progress at https://opendatascotland.github.io/the_od_bods/ which feeds the website at https://opendata.scot The goal this weekend was to fix the data coming through from the APIs.

### Air Aberdeen
This project was discussed again to see how it might be revived further. The original site [Air Aberdeen]( https://www.airaberdeen.org) needed updating, and others were looking at seeing what's feasible with the sensor.community APIs by building on the work from [CTC16](https://github.com/AirAberdeen/CTC16-Data-Gathering), which is gathered into an [Air Aberdeen repo](https://github.com/AirAberdeen)

### Wikipedia Editathon
Is working on a number of projects which can be watched on the [CTC25 Dashboard](https://outreachdashboard.wmflabs.org/courses/CTC_and_WMUK/CTC25_Feb_2022).
